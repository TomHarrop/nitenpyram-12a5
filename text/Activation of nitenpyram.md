### Abstract

Nitenpyram is a member of the economically important neonicotinoid class of insecticides. The *in vivo* metabolism of nitenpyram is not well characterised, but cytochrome P450 activity is the major mechanism of resistance to neonicotinoids and P450s metabolise other neonicotinoids including imidacloprid. We used RNAi of the cytochrome P450 redox partners with GAL4/UAS targeting to interrupt P450 functions in specific tissues in *Drosophila melanogaster*. RNAi of the mitochondrial redox partner *dare* in the digestive tissues reduced nitenpyram mortality, indicating an activation step in the metabolism of nitenpyram carried out by a mitochondrial P450. RNAi of the mitochondrial P450 *Cyp12a5*, which is expressed in the digestive tissues, resulted in the same phenotype, and transgenic overexpression of *Cyp12a5* increased nitenpyram sensitivity. These results suggest that *in vivo* metabolism of nitenpyram by the mitochondrial P450, CYP12A5, results in the formation of a product with higher toxicity than the parent compound.

## Introduction

Cytochrome P450 genes (P450s) are found in all eukaryotic organisms and are involved in diverse physiological processes. Some insect P450s have essential developmental roles in hormone synthesis and degradation, while others act as drug metabolizing enzymes (DMEs **Is this the current term? Can we call them xenobiotic-metabolising enzymes instead?**) capable of modifying the chemical structure of insecticides from different classes and affecting resistance. Increased expression of P450s is often positively associated with resistance, particularly to the neonicotinoid class of insecticides (Bass et. al 2015). Individual P450s have been associated with neonicotinoid resistance by comparing transcript levels between resistant and susceptible strains or by genetic mapping (*e.g.* Daborn 2002, Karunker 2008, Puinean 2010, Bass 2011, Bass 2013, Ding 2013, Yang et. al 2013 **any examples of mapping neonicitonoid resistance to P450s, other than *Cyp6g1*?**), and some candidates have been confirmed by transgenic overexpression in *Drosophila melanogaster* (Daborn et. al 2002, Zhu et. al 2010, Daborn et. al 2012, Bass et. al 2013).

**Add a sentence or two about nitenpyram targets/chemistry/metabolism? There are some refs in Tomizawa (DOI: 10.1146/annurev.pharmtox.45.120403.095930) but I don't understand the chemistry, and I couldn't get full text**. The *in vivo* metabolism of nitenpyram is not well characterised, but studies of imidacloprid metablism challenge the earlier paradigm that P450-mediated metabolism of neonicotinoids always leads to detoxification. P450 metabolites of imidacloprid have been identified and characterised *in vitro* and *in vivo* (Joußen et. al 2008, Hoi et. al 2014), and some metabolites are more toxic than the parent insecticide. In particular, the olefin metabolite has a lower LC~50~ and higher affinity for the neonicotinoid target protein, nAChR, than the parent compound (Nauen et. al 1998), but is more **rapidly?** excreted from *D. melanogaster* larvae (Fusetto et. al 2017 **could you send me this paper?**). 

P450 peptide sequences form four phylogenetic clades, three of proteins localised to the endoplasmic reticulum and one of enzymes localised to mitochondria (Ranson et. al 2002, Feyereisen 2006). Although all vertebrate mitochondrial P450s appear to have developmental functions (Guengerich et. al 2005), mitochondrial P450s can function in development or as DMEs in arthropods (Gilbert et. al 2004, Daborn et. al 2007). We report evidence that *Cyp12a5*, a mitochondrial P450, is involved in *in vivo* metabolism of nitenpyram in *D. melanogaster*, possibly forming a metabolite with higher toxicity than the parent compound.

## Material and methods 

### Transgenic fly lines

To generate *Cpr* and *dare* RNA interference (RNAi) lines, we amplified two non-overlapping RNAi fragments from each gene (Supplementary figure 1) using the Expand High Fidelity Plus PCR System (Roche Applied Science), cloned them into pGEM-T Easy (Promega) and subcloned them twice in separate steps into the *Nhe*I and *Avr*II sites of pWIZ (Lee and Carthew 2003) so that the fragment was in the opposite direction in each site. The primers are listed in Supplementary table 1. The recombinant plasmids were transformed into the *w*^1118^ strain of *D. melanogaster* and transgenic progeny with autosomal insertions were selected for further characterisation.

We constructed *Cyp12a4* and *Cyp12a5* UAS lines by amplifying the open reading frames from the *y* ; *cn bw sp* reference strain of *D. melanogaster* using Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England BioLabs), cloning them into pGEM-T Easy and subcloning them into the pUASt-attB vector (Bischof et al. 2007) via the *Not*I sites. We injected the recombinant plasmids into a target strain of genotype *y*^1^ M{vas-int.Dm}ZH-2A *w*^\*^ ; P{CaryP}attP40 (hereinafter attP40 background), carrying the X-chromosome from Bloomington stock 24482 and the autosomes from Bloomington stock 25709 **is this correct?**. We used  strains from the Vienna Drosophila Resource Centre KK library for RNAi knockdown of *Cyp12a4* and *Cyp12a5* (VDRC stock numbers 107088 and 103961, respectively). 

### *Cpr* and *dare* RNAi phenotyping 

We tested the lethality of ubiquitous RNAi knockdown of *Cpr* and *dare* by crossing male RNAi lines to virgin female 5′*tubulin* and 5′*Actin* driver lines (Bloomington stock numbers 5138 and 3954) and counted emergence of progeny after 15 days.

To determine the life stage mortality of flies expressing the *Cpr* and *dare* RNAi constructs in the prothoracic gland, we crossed the RNAi lines to a 5′*phantom* driver (Guittard et al 2011), using a cross between the driver and *w*^1118^ to control genetic background. We assayed mortality by placing three replicates of 20 eggs from each cross in normal Drosophila food vials. Emerging adults were scored as *Cy*^1^ (control) or *Cy*^+^ (RNAi). The driver line included a balancer chromosome that constitutively expresses GFP (*CyO*-GFP), and larvae expressing GAL4 were collected at first instar larval stage using a SZX12 fluorescence stereomicroscope (Olympus). We determined life stage mortality by individually raising non-GFP first instar larvae in 5 mL vials containing 1 mL of normal Drosophila medium (*n* = 40). We supplied pulses of 8.7 μg of 20-hydroxyecdysone in a yeast paste wetted with 10 % v/v ethanol after two and six days to half of the larvae. The remaining larvae were treated with yeast paste wetted with ethanol without 20-hydroxyecdysone. We inspected vials daily to determine life stage and mortality.

To measure the lethality of *Cpr* and *dare* RNAi in the *D. melanogaster* digestive system, we crossed male RNAi lines to virgin females with the 5′*Cyp6g1*HR construct, which drives GAL4 production in the midgut, Malpighian tubules and fat body (Chung et al 2007), over a TM6b, *Tb*^1^ balancer chromosome. We inferred lethality by scoring the ratio of adults emerging with the balancer phenotype (*Antp*^Hu^).

### Insecticide bioassays

The homozygous 5′*Cyp6g1*HR-3a driver line (Chung et al 2007) was used for all bioassays, and crosses with the recipient strain of the *Cpr* and *dare* or *Cyp12a4* and *Cyp12a5* RNAi constructs (*w*^1118^ or Bloomington stock 60100, respectively) or the attP40 background were used to control genetic background. We exposed replicates of 20 four-day-old, mated, adult female progeny to discriminating doses of 2, 4 or 8 μg·vial^−1^ of DDT (Sigma) using 24 hour contact assays in glass scintillation vials (Daborn et al., 2001). We reared replicates of 25 or 50 first instar larvae on food containing discriminating doses of 1 or 1.5 × 10^−4^ % w/v nitenpyram (Novartis) and 0.9 or 1.1 × 10^−6^ w/v dicyclanil (Novartis) and counted emergence after 15 days. Bioassays for the RNAi constructs were were performed on semolina medium, while corn meal medium was used in the *Cyp12a4* and *Cyp12a5* overexpression bioassays **do we have refs for normal/hoff food?**. We corrected mortality data for control mortality using Abbott’s formula (Hoekstra, 1987), and calculated confidence intervals that take into account the error in both control and experimental mortality using formulae described by Rosenheim and Hoy (1989).

### Overexpression and RNAi quantification

To quantify the knockdown of *Cpr* and *dare*, we collected three biological replicates of five midguts from first and third instar larvae and four-day-old adults. We homogonized tissues in TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) at 20.0 Hz for 4 minutes in a Mixer Mill MM 400 (Retsch), and isolated RNA from the homogenate by chloroform extraction and isopropanol precipitation. After testing RNA quality and yield by agarose gel electrophoresis and fluorometric assay (Qubit Fluorometer, Invitrogen), we generated cDNA with the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) using random hexamer oligonucleotides. We validated the primers for use with the $e^{- \Delta \Delta C_{T}}$ method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001; Vandesompele et al., 2002), and used SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosciences) for quantitative real-time RT-PCR with a RotorGene RG-3000 (Corbett). We quantified *Cyp12a4* and *Cyp12a5* overexpression with the same method, except that we extracted RNA with TRISure reagent (Bioline) and generated cDNA with GoScript Reverse Transcriptase (Promega). Primers used for real-time PCR are listed in Supplementary table 1.

## Results

### RNAi of *dare*, a mitochondrial P450 redox partner, reduces nitenpyram mortality

To detect phenotypes caused by disruption of cytochrome P450 functions in specific tissues, we generated an RNAi system to interrupt the functions of two P450 redox partners, *Cpr* and *dare*, under control of the GAL4-UAS system. We tested two non-overlapping UAS-RNAi constructs for each redox partner (Supplementary figure 1). Ubiquitous RNAi with the 5′*tubulin* driver or specific RNAi in the prothoracic gland using the 5′*phantom* driver resulted in lethality (Figure 1A; Supplementary figure 2A). The second instar mortality caused by RNAi in the prothoracic gland was rescued by the addition 20-hydroxyecdysone in both *Cpr* RNAi lines, suggesting that RNAi of *Cpr* inhibits P450 functions. The low dose of 20-hydroxyecdysone did not rescue larval mortality of prothoracic gland RNAi of *dare*, although the number of days the third instar larvae survived increased for one construct (Figure 1A–B).

We then used the redox partner RNAi system to investigate phenotypes related to P450-based metabolism of insecticides in the insect digestive system. We crossed the redox partner RNAi lines to the 5′*Cyp6g1*HR-3a driver, which produces GAL4 in the midgut, Malpighian tubules and fat body. We detected 60–80% removal of *Cpr* mRNA and 70–90% of *dare* mRNA in midguts from first instar larval, third instar larval and adult progeny by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (Table 1). To assess the lethality of the redox partner RNAi system in these tissues, we crossed heterozygous flies carrying the driver transgene and a balancer chromosome (genotype 5′*Cyp6g1*HR-3a / *TM6B*, *Tb*^1^) to the *Cpr* and *dare* RNAi lines. There was no reduction in emergence of *Antp*^+^ progeny (Supplementary figure 2B), suggesting that RNAi of the P450 redox partners in these tissues does not cause developmental lethality.
    
To assess the effect of *Cpr* and *dare* knockdown in the *D. melanogaster* digestive tissues, we reared flies expressing the UAS-RNAi constructs under control of the 5′*Cyp6g1*HR-3a driver on nitenpyram or dicyclanil or exposed them to DDT as adults. Mortality of flies expressing either *dare* RNAi construct reared on two different concentrations of nitenpyram was higher compared to control crosses (Figure 2A), but no difference in DDT or dicyclanil mortality was detected (Supplementary figure 3) This suggests that metabolism of nitenpyram by one or more mitochondrial P450s expressed in the midgut, Malpighian tubules or fat body leads to the formation of a more toxic product.

### Modulation of *Cyp12a5* expression level affects nitenpyram mortality

Four mitochondrial P450s were detected by *in situ* hybridisation in the *y* ; *cn bw sp* strain of *D. melanogaster* (Chung et al 2009), and a further three were detected at low levels in RNA sequencing of midguts from transgenic flies in the *w*^1118^ background (Supplementary figure 4; Harrop et al. 2014). **Will the reviewers ask about the other genes? I can't remember why we didn't try 12d1. Maybe there was no KK line at the time.** To test the role of individual mitochondrial P450s in nitenpyram resistance, we reared first instar larvae expressing RNAi constructs against *Cyp12a4* and *Cyp12a5* under control of the 5′*Cyp6g1*HR-3a driver on nitenpyram medium. Mortality was lower than the control cross for *Cyp12a5* flies, but not for *Cyp12a4* flies (Figure 2B). This suggests that *Cyp12a5* is a candidate for activation of nitenpyram in the *D. melanogaster* digestive tissues.

To test the effect of constitutive overexpression of *Cyp12a4* and *Cyp12a5*, we crossed transgenic UAS lines containing the open reading frame from each gene (UAS-*Cyp12a4* and UAS-*Cyp12a5*) to the 5′*Cyp6g1*HR-3a driver and reared first instar larval progeny on nitenpyram. Flies overexpressing *Cyp12a5* had increased mortality compared to the control cross, whereas no change in mortality was detected for *Cyp12a4* (Figure 2C **Shane: is the strain labelled UAS-null the background (injected) strain, or did you inject empty pUASt-attB?**). Overexpression resulted in a relative increase *Cyp12a4* mRNA of **X** and a relative increase in *Cyp12a5* mRNA of **Y** (Table 2). These results support the negative correlation between *Cyp12a5* expression and nitenpyram resistance.

Because resistance to lufenuron maps to the *Cyp12a4*/*Cyp12a5* region (Bogwitz 2005), we also reared first instar larvae overexpressing *Cyp12a4* or *Cyp12a5* on lufenuron. Mortality of UAS-*Cyp12a4* progeny decreased on lufenuron compared to the control cross, but no change was observed for UAS-*Cyp12a5* progeny (Supplementary figure 5). **Lufenuron doses for M&M?**

## Discussion

Knockdown of *Cpr* or *dare* either ubiquitously or specifically in the prothoracic gland, where the moulting hormone ecdysone is synthesised from cholesterol (reviewed by Ou and King-Jones, 2013), resulted in mortality. This was expected, as knockdown or mutation of individual P450s that are involved in ecdysone production is also lethal (Chávez 2000, Warren 2002, Petryk 2003, Warren 2004, Ono 2006, Chung 2007, Christesen 2017). Previous manipulations of *Cpr* expression have suggested P450 functions in xenobiotic metabolism and hydrocarbon biosynthesis. Transgenic RNAi of *Cpr* in *D. melanogaster* oenocytes resulted in a decrease in cuticular hydrocarbon, consistent with the role of *Cyp4g1* in that tissue (Qiu et al 2012). Injection of double-stranded *CPR* RNA increased permethrin sensitivity in *Anopheles gambiae* (Lycett 2006), and a similar technique increased susceptibility to deltamethrin in *Cimex lectularius* (Zhu et al 2012). In our experiments, the partial rescue of *Cpr* RNAi mortality by the addition of 20-hydroxyecdysone indicates that redox partner RNAi interrupts P450 function. Our results are also consistent with the existence in the prothoracic gland of other P450 functions, or functions of other enzymes that are supplied with electrons by *Cpr* or *dare*, which are essential for development aside from the production and activation of ecdysone.

*Cpr* and *dare* knockdown in the digestive tissues (the Malpighian tubules, midgut and fat body) did not cause mortality, but RNAi of *dare* resulted in nitenpyram resistance, suggesting the involvement of a mitochondrial P450 in nitenpyram metabolism. Transgenic manipulation of expression of the mitochondrial P450 gene *Cyp12a5* mirrored these results. Mitochondrial P450s from mammalian genomes do not generally metabolise xenobiotics (Guengerich et al 2005). In contrast, although insect P450s from the mitochondrial clade function in the synthesis of ecdysone (Rewitz et al 2007), some are involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics. *M. domestica* CYP12A1 converts diazinon to diazoxon *in vitro* (Guzov et al, 1998), and lufenuron resistance maps to the *Cyp12a4*/*Cyp12a5* locus in *D. melanogaster* is conferred by overexpression of *Cyp12a4* (Bogwitz 2005). *Cyp12d1* is overexpressed in strains resistant to DDT (Brandt et al., 2002; Le Goff et al., 2003), and transgenic expression confers resistance to DDT and dicyclanil (Daborn 2007). Despite the functions of mitochondrial P450 in xenobiotic metabolism, activation of neonicotinoids by mitochondrial P450s has not been reported.

P450 overexpression is a major mechanism of resistance to neonicotinoids (reviewed by **Bass 2015**), and transgenic overexpression of two other *D. melanogaster* P450 genes, *Cyp6g1* and *Cyp6g2*, suggests that P450-based metabolism of nitenpyram can confer resistance (**Daborn 2007**). Similarly, constitutive overexpression of P450s is associated with resistance in field populations of pests including *Bemisia tabaci*, *Myzus persicae* and *Nilaparvata lugens* (Karunker 2008, Puinean 2010, Bass 2011, Bass 2013, Ding 2013, Yang et. al 2013). In contrast, the correlation between *Cyp12a5* expression and nitenpyram mortality that we report suggests CYP12A5 activity increases the toxicity of nitenpyram *in vivo*. CYP6G1 expression correlates with the increased production of the toxic olefin metabolite of imidacloprid *in vivo* and *in vitro* (Joußen 2008, Fusetto 2017), which has higher affinity for nAChRs than nitenpyram does (Nauen 1998), although CYP6G1 does not form the olefin directly (**Fuesetto?**). The mammalian P450 CYP3A4 is also proposed to activate imidacloprid (Honda, 2006), and another neonicotinoid, thiamethoxam, appears to be activated by insects or plants into the more toxic clothianidin (Nauen 2003). P450 enzymes from *D. melanogaster* and *Musca domestica* also activate the organophosphate insecticide diazinon (Dunkov et al., 1997; Guzov et al., 1998; Sabourault et al., 2001). The change in nitenpyram toxicity correlated to *Cyp12a5* expression may relate to altered affinity between metabolites and the target nAChRs, modified excretion kinetics of metabolites, or even the mitochondrial location of the CYP12A5 enzyme, but our results do not distinguish between these possibilities. Determination of CYP12A5 metabolites of nitenpyram would therefore be of interest. Despite the clear role of *Cyp6g1* in DDT metabolism (Daborn 2002, Joußen 2008, Cheesman 2013 **any other 6g1-ddt refs?**), we did not detect a change in DDT sensitivity in *Cpr* RNAi lines. Different effects of *Cyp6g1* RNAi on DDT mortality have been reported (Yang et al 2007, McCart et al 2008), possibly associated with the resistance status of the strain used (**which Strycharz paper?**). The *w*^1118^ strain we used in our RNAi experiments is naïve to insecticides and may have low constitutive tolerance to DDT, making it impossible to detect increased DDT sensitivity.

Nonetheless, we detected an increase in nitenpyram resistance in *dare* RNAi flies, suggesting that interruption of redox partner function may be useful to test a broader range of insecticide classes for P450 metabolism. Our results show that interruption of P450 function in the midguts, Malpighian tubules and fat body does not cause significant lethality, and crossing the RNAi constructs into resistant *D. melanogaster* backgrounds or injecting *Cpr* and *dare* dsRNAs into pest species may yield results analogous to the use of P450 inhibitors and be useful for detecting P450-based metabolism of insecticides and other functions.

## Figure legends

**Figure 1**. Effect of *Cpr* and *dare* RNAi in the prothoracic gland. (A) Number of adults that emerged from 20 eggs. The balancer chromosome carries the *Cy*^O^ allele and does not produce *GAL4*. No adults with the *Cy*^+^ phenotype emerged from crosses with the RNAi lines, indicating that RNAi of *Cpr* or *dare* in the prothoracic gland is lethal. (B) Number of days at each developmental stage. *Cpr*-RNAi1 flies died before the 3^rd^ instar larval stage, whereas *Cpr*-RNAi2 and *dare* RNAi flies died before the pupal stage. Addition of two pulses of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20HE) rescued the first or second instar mortality of *Cpr*-RNAi1 flies and increased the number of days *dare*-RNAi2 flies survived. (C) Percentage survival between developmental stages. 20HE rescued the 1^st^ to 3^rd^ instar survival of *Cpr* RNAi flies to wild-type levels but did not affect survival later in development. The genotypes indicated in (B) and (C) are the male parents that were crossed to virgin 5′*phantom* females, which produces *GAL4* in the prothoracic gland (Guittard et al 2011).

**Figure 2**. Nitenpyram bioassays. Mortality of (A) *dare* RNAi flies and (B) *Cyp12a5* RNAi flies was reduced, and mortality of (C) flies overexpressing *Cyp12a5* was increased. The error bars show 95% confidence interval for corrected mortality from 10 replicates at each dose.
